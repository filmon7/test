Version 1
I have created another repository named test. I included Readme file as the
result master branch was created by default.
I cloned the test repo into my working directory. I learned that the location of
the cloned folder will be int eh active directory

Now i am trying to eadit read me from atom text editor as bash cant open read.md
file.
But i dont know how to save changes

Version 2
I pushed my commited changes to my remote repo test. git push origin master worked and it reflected on my github. Now i am going to etch it into my local repository.

Version 3
I succcesfully fetched the remote change. Surprisingly it worked well without
mentining any other further swithch.
I loved the --dry-run after any command. It will check the demo and you will
know if it works or not

But after fetching my work was not updated so i have to merge it. git merge was
used but it required switch so i used --stat. my work was updated.

This is the safest way to do things 

Version 4
I have successfuly pushed teh new change agin. Now let me try to pull instead of fetch + merge. But i have to make sure that everytthing is committed in my loal repo
